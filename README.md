# Resources version change 

Python script developed to help us faster change to the new version of resources (WSDL, XSD). 

## Config setup

1. Update the configRun.py script with the namespaces that needs to be found and replaced
2. Set the project directory to correct path. 
3. Backup the project before you run the script. - If needed, but you can always just download the latest version from GIT
4. Set the files that you want to exclude from changes

cd C:\dev\GIT\IPTools\versioncange

2. run the configRun.py script in windows:
python configRun.py
